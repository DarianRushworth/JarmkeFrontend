                Kristina Jarmke Matthews has produced a jewellery collection that creates 
                awareness to phyiscal and mental health conditions in a unique way.
                She has taken inspiration from her own life with present and past 
                challenges that she has faced dealing with the condition of 
                Fibromyalgia. Not only are her pieces symbolic in the sense of creating 
                awareness, but also help the wearer understand the conditions through the 
                dynamic or kinetic aspects incorporated into the design.
                </p>

                In her Collection she has highlighted four areas of focus each with their own
                mini-colloction:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fibromyalgia</li>
                    <li>Depression</li>
                    <li>Aniexty</li>
                    <li>Hearing Impairment</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                <strong>Fibromyalgia</strong>- Inspired from her own personal story. She wanted to create pieces
                that help the wearer understand what it's like to deal with this condition
                on a daily basis, through the movement of the jewellery pieces.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Depression</strong>- Reflects the numerous people she knows who are dealing with the condition
                and the weighted pieces bring the wearer that feeling of heaviness
                and being weighed down.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Aniexty</strong>- This collection was inspired by the chaotic
                and anxious feeling of aniexty. She aimed to create jewellery pieces that 
                feel busy and almost out of your control.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Hearing Impairment</strong>- Inspired by her boyfriend's sister,
                Chloe and some of Chloe's doodles and drawings. The pieces and shapes for 
                this collection are also a metephor for Chloe in her own happy bubble.

                This subtle awareness jewellery reflects the difficult private journeys
                that individuals have to walk and wearing a piece of jewellery that honours
                a condition promotes positivity and engenders empathy and understanding
                from those without these conditions.
